# Pedal - FHA Recovery Support App

## üå∏ Project Overview

Pedal is a compassionate, AI-powered web application designed to support individuals recovering from Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea (FHA). Built with empathy at its core, Pedal provides gentle guidance, personalized insights, and encouraging tools to help users navigate their recovery journey with confidence and self-compassion.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Functional Hypothalamic Amenorrhea affects countless individuals, often stemming from inadequate nutrition, excessive exercise, or chronic stress. Recovery requires not just medical guidance, but emotional support and lifestyle adjustments. Traditional health apps often focus on restriction and metrics that can be triggering for those in recovery. There was a clear need for a supportive, recovery-focused platform that celebrates progress without judgment.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multiple Flower Varieties**: Daily randomization keeps the experience fresh and engaging
- **Micro-celebrations**: Every small step forward is acknowledged and celebrated

### üçΩÔ∏è AI-Powered Meal Analysis
- **Gemini AI Integration**: Sophisticated meal analysis providing encouraging, specific nutritional feedback
- **Image & Text Support**: Users can upload photos or describe meals in natural language
- **Recovery-Focused Guidance**: All feedback emphasizes nourishment and energy rather than restriction

### üìä Predictive Health Insights
- **LSTM Neural Networks**: Advanced machine learning models predict period recovery likelihood

- **Nivo Charts**: Beautiful, interactive data visualizations
- **Lucide Icons**: Consistent, accessible iconography

## üé® Design Philosophy

Pedal's design centers around **gentle encouragement** rather than clinical tracking. Every visual element, from the soft color palette (#87C4BB teal, #FFB4A2 peach, #C1A7E1 lavender) to the blooming flower metaphors, reinforces the message that recovery is a natural, beautiful process deserving of patience and self-love.

## üöÄ Innovation Highlights

2. **Predictive Modeling**: Advanced ML models providing personalized recovery timelines
3. **Gentle Gamification**: Progress visualization that celebrates without triggering
4. **Holistic Approach**: Combines nutrition, mental health, and medical insights
5. **Recovery-First Design**: Every feature designed with eating disorder recovery principles

## üèÜ Impact & Future Vision

Pedal represents a new paradigm in health technology - one that prioritizes mental wellbeing alongside physical recovery. By combining cutting-edge AI with compassionate design, we're creating a tool that doesn't just track health metrics, but actively supports healing.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Healthcare provider integration for collaborative care
- Community features for peer support
- Expanded AI capabilities for personalized meal planning
- Integration with wearable devices for seamless tracking
- Multilingual support for global accessibility
